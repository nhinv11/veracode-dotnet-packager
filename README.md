# DEPRECATED, PLEASE USE THE OFFICIAL PACKAGER AT: https://docs.veracode.com/r/About_auto_packaging

Please note that this is not an official Veracode project, not supported by Veracode in any form, and comes with no warranty whatsoever. It is simply a little pet project of mine trying to make the life of Veracode's DotNet customers a bit easier. Use at your own risk.

Please feel free to extend the existing functionality, followed by a `Merge Request` ‚ù§Ô∏è.
